â€œBeing an Electronics engineer, I understand the complete functionality of an e
lectronic device but I am very much eager to know about the software development part for a particular hardware platform without which a hardware has no worth. So, for my complete knowledge and understanding of hardware, it is necessary for me to learn about software development process which is not possible without joining an IT industry. It will help me to
 corelate these two different areas which are mutually dependent to each other.
